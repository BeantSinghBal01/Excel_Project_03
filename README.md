## Showcasing My Recent Excel Dashboard Project: Global Electronics Retailer Analysis

I am excited to share my latest project, where I developed a comprehensive Excel dashboard to analyze the performance of a global electronics retailer. The dashboard provides actionable insights into key business metrics such as orders, revenue, average order value (AOV), and delivery days, broken down by countries, years, and product categories.

### Key Highlights:

- âœ… **Designed an interactive dashboard** for decision-making, with features like monthly revenue trends and category-wise breakdowns.
- âœ… **Utilized advanced Excel techniques**, including Power Query, DAX, and Pivot Tables, to manage and transform data efficiently.
- âœ… **Integrated insights from an entity-relationship diagram (ERD)** for a robust data structure, connecting sales, products, customers, and stores.

### ðŸ“ˆ Insights Provided by the Dashboard:

- **Computers** lead category sales with **$19M in revenue**.
- **Seasonal revenue trends**, with peaks in **January** and **December**.
- Clear visualization of **key performance indicators** for quick decision-making.

### ðŸ’» Tools and Techniques Used:

- **Excel** for data visualization and modeling.
- A structured **ERD** for understanding data relationships.
- **Analytical storytelling** to support business strategies.

This project has been an exciting journey in enhancing my data visualization and storytelling skills. If you're working on similar projects or are passionate about analytics, Iâ€™d love to connect and exchange ideas!
